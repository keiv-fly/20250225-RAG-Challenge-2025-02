       "'{0}------------------------------------------------\\n\\n![](_page_0_Picture_0.jpeg)\\n\\n# 2022 Annual Report\\n\\n{1}------------------------------------------------\\n\\n{2}------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDear Fellow Shareholder,\\n\\nWe are pleased to provide you an update on the progress of your investments in ACRES Commercial Realty Corp. (\"ACR\" or the \"Company\"). During the past year, our manager has continued to make progress on the core tenets of its responsibilities to manage the existing assets in the portfolio, originate new loan assets, facilitate the financing of the assets, and control costs to drive earnings and increase book value per share. We are pleased to report that substantial progress has been made on all fronts and we remain focused on these mandates going forward.\\n\\nThe ACRES team continued to diligently manage our assets and provide exceptional service for our borrowers. We worked proactively with these borrowers to address their needs so that they could maintain payments on their loans. These efforts have resulted in a high-quality, stabilized book to build on.\\n\\nWe are proud of the success we achieved in 2022 and are optimistic in our ability to deliver shareholder value over the long term.\\n\\n# **Selective Growth & Attractive Financing Vehicles**\\n\\nDuring 2022, we selectively grew the Company\\'s loan portfolio by leveraging ACRES\\'s complementary lending pipeline and network of sponsor relationships. We are pleased to note that we closed over \\\\$610 million of commercial real estate first-mortgage commitments in 2022.\\n\\nAdditionally, we carefully pursued opportunities to make direct equity investments in real estate in 2022, ultimately acquiring two properties for a total of \\\\$51.6 million. We expect that these investments may yield enhanced returns in the long term that, we will be able to substantially shield from taxes due to the existence of ACR\\'s considerable tax assets and ultimately reinvest into the loan origination pipeline.\\n\\nWe recognize that building on this momentum is essential. Therefore, the ACRES team is vigilant in identifying and executing on opportunities to grow asset-specific financing with duration at attractive coupon rates that can raise our capacity to originate loans. In addition, we have the reinvestment window available on our two ACR securitizations through May 2023 and December 2023. The bulk of the Company\\'s current portfolio was originated in 2021 and 2022, comprising 84% of the current par balance and have initial maturities of 2024 or later and extended maturities of 2026 or later.\\n\\n# **Portfolio Stability**\\n\\nThe ACRES asset management team prides itself on its ability to tailor solutions that will keep borrowers on track despite challenges that may arise. Current volatility and uncertainty in the market have proved to be such challenges, but ones we\\'ve been able to manage as a result of our proactive asset management approach.\\n\\nThanks to our asset management team, we\\'ve reduced our watch list to 5% of the loan portfolio at the end of 2022, down from 8% at the end of 2021. In January 2023, one watch list loan, a hotel portfolio in the southwest region with a par value of \\\\$56.5 million was paid off in full, which reduced the value of our watch list loans in half as compared to year end 2022.\\n\\n{3}------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2022, 95% of the loan portfolio was performing in line or near underwritten expectations and a significant majority of loans were current on contractual payments, which is an improvement from 92% at December 31, 2021.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2022, 100% of our loan portfolio by carrying value earned a floating rate of interest and was financed entirely with liabilities that both pay interest at floating rates. Additionally, 89% of the par value of our floating-rate loan portfolio was covered by borrowerowned interest rate caps that provided additional credit protection to the Company in the current rising interest rate environment.\\n\\n# **Capital Markets Flexibility**\\n\\nWe worked closely with our lenders and executed as planned to provide the Company maximum flexibility given the challenging business environment in 2022.\\n\\nWe finalized terms with Mass Mutual under its non-mark-to-market agreement to upsize the commitment and to provide for individual loan series that will each have a five-year term from the date of issuance. Additionally, we have warehouse lines open with JPM and Morgan Stanley, each collateralized by performing loans and each with excess capacity to support future originations.\\n\\nIn August 2022, we repaid the remaining outstanding 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes upon maturity at par.\\n\\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased 849,000 shares of common stock at an average price of \\\\$10.35, which contributed \\\\$1.32 per share to common stock book value since we were able to repurchase the shares at prices significantly below our common stock book value. Common stock book value was \\\\$24.54 at December 31, 2022, up 3% from December 31, 2021.\\n\\n# **Corporate Responsibility**\\n\\nIn undertaking our ESG strategy, we are particularly focused on identifying and executing programs that ensure our dedication to diversity and inclusion and emphasize ethical behavior. We are committed to integrating ESG policies and practices into our operational, investment and development strategies to build a sustainable future.\\n\\nDuring 2022, we announced a new initiative called \"ACRES Protects an Acre\" initiative, in which ACRES will make a donation in connection with each loan it closes to a nonprofit organization whose mission is to protect acres of vulnerable land. Additionally, early in 2023, we announced a partnership with Project Destined, an organization that provides training in financial literacy, entrepreneurship, and real estate to students from underserved communities.\\n\\n# **Looking Ahead**\\n\\nAs we look ahead to 2023, we have established a goal to get the Company fully invested to drive meaningful earnings that can be re-invested back into the loan origination pipeline. We expect our accomplishments in 2022 will help to pave the way to attaining that goal.\\n\\n{4}------------------------------------------------\\n\\n{5}------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[This page intentionally left blank]\\n\\n{6}------------------------------------------------\\n\\n# **UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Washington, D.C. 20549**\\n\\n# **FORM 10-K**\\n\\n(Mark One)\\n\\n☑ **ANNUAL REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934** \\n\\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022\\n\\n# ☐ **TRANSITION REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934**\\n\\nFor the transition period from \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_ to \\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\n\\n**Commission file number 1-32733** \\n\\nor\\n\\n![](_page_6_Picture_8.jpeg)\\n\\n# **ACRES COMMERCIAL REALTY CORP.**\\n\\n(Exact name of registrant as specified in its charter)\\n\\n| Maryland                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                        | 20-2287134                                                     |\\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\\n| (State or other jurisdiction of                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                        | (I.R.S.

BUSINESS**\\n\\n### **General**\\n\\nWe are a Maryland corporation, incorporated in 2005, and a real estate finance company that is organized and conducts our operations to qualify as a real estate investment trust (\"REIT\") for federal income tax purposes under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. On February 16, 2021, we amended our certificate of incorporation to change our name to ACRES Commercial Realty Corp. from Exantas Capital Corp. Our investment strategy is primarily focused on originating, holding and managing commercial real estate (\"CRE\") mortgage loans and equity investments in commercial real estate property through direct ownership and joint ventures. We are externally managed by ACRES Capital, LLC (our \"Manager\") a subsidiary of ACRES Capital Corp. (collectively \"ACRES\"), a private commercial real estate lender exclusively dedicated to nationwide middle market CRE lending with a focus on multifamily, student housing, hospitality, industrial and office property in top United States, or U.S., markets. Our Manager draws upon the management team of ACRES and its collective investment experience to provide its services.\\n\\nOur objective is to provide our stockholders with total returns over time, including the payment of quarterly distributions when approved by our board of directors, (our \"Board\") and capital appreciation, while seeking to manage the risks associated with our investment strategies. We finance a substantial portion of our portfolio investments through borrowing strategies seeking to match the maturities and repricing dates of our financings with the maturities and repricing dates of our investments.\\n\\nOur investment strategy targets the following CRE credit investments, including:\\n\\n- Floating-rate first mortgage loans, which we refer to as whole loans;\\n- First priority interests in first mortgage loans, which we refer to as A-notes;\\n- Subordinated interests in first mortgage loans, which we refer to as B-notes;\\n- Preferred equity investments related to CRE that are subordinate to first mortgage loans and are not collateralized by the property underlying the investment; and\\n- CRE equity investments.\\n\\nWe generate our income primarily from the spread between the revenues we receive from our assets and the cost to finance our ownership of those assets, including corporate debt.\\n\\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") was identified. The resulting spread of COVID-19 throughout the globe led the World Health Organization to designate COVID-19 as a pandemic and numerous countries, including the U.S, to declare national emergencies. Many countries responded to the initial and ensuing outbreaks of COVID-19 by instituting quarantines and restrictions on travel and limiting operations of non-essential offices and retail centers, which resulted in the closure or remote operation of non-essential businesses and increased rates of unemployment and market disruption in connection with the economic uncertainty. While the U.S. and certain countries around the world have eased restrictions and financial markets and unemployment rates have stabilized to some degree, the pandemic continues to cause uncertainty in the U.S. and global economies, generally, and the CRE industry in particular.\\n\\nThe aforementioned quarantines and travel restrictions contributed significantly to economic disruptions across the country that directly impacted our borrowers and their ability to pay and to stay current with their debt obligations in 2019 and 2020, causing significant increases in our provisions for credit losses. During this height of the pandemic, we used a variety of legal and structural options to manage credit risk effectively, including through forbearance and extension provisions or agreements. As of December 31, 2022, we have substantially reversed those provisions due to significant improvements in our current and expected macroeconomic operating environments as well as due to improvements in collateral operating performance and market liquidity.\\n\\nWe continue to actively and responsibly manage corporate liquidity and operations in light of the market disruptions caused by COVID-19. However, it is inherently difficult to accurately assess the continuing impact of the pandemic as well as other domestic or global events on our revenues, profitability and financial position. In response, we are focused on maintaining sufficient liquidity while still growing our loan origination business. We continuously monitor the effects of domestic and global events on our operations and financial position to ensure that we remain responsive and adaptable to the dynamic changes in our operating environment.\\n\\nThe negative impact of COVID-19 on our commercial mortgage-backed securities, or CMBS, investments and 2020 results created a net operating loss (\"NOL\") carryforwards and net capital loss carryforwards (\"CLCFs\"). Our 2020 tax return, completed in October 2021, resulted in NOL carryforwards of \\\\$47.7 million and CLCFs of \\\\$136.9 million, including net capital loss carryforwards \\n\\n{11}------------------------------------------------\\n\\nfrom prior years, at our qualified REIT subsidiaries (\"QRSs\"). Our 2021 tax return, completed in October 2022, resulted in NOL utilization of \\\\$1.1 million and CLCF utilization of \\\\$15.0 million. Additionally, we have NOL carryforwards of \\\\$60.1 million and CLCFs of \\\\$1.0 million at our taxable REIT subsidiaries (\"TRSs\").\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2022, we have acquired equity investments in CRE properties to utilize CLCFs in our QRSs. These equity investments offer the opportunity for enhanced capital appreciation returns that may be reinvested into the loan origination pipeline when and if realized.\\n\\nWe typically target transitional floating-rate CRE loans between \\\\$10.0 million and \\\\$100.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2022 we originated 19 CRE loans with total commitments of \\\\$610.8 million. At December 31, 2022, our CRE loan portfolio comprised \\\\$2.1 billion of floating-rate CRE whole loans with a weighted average spread of 3.78% over the one-month benchmark interest rates utilized, which have a weighted average floor of 0.68%, excluding one whole loan without a benchmark floor. Additionally, our CRE loan portfolio comprised one fully reserved \\\\$4.7 million mezzanine loan at December 31, 2022.\\n\\n# **Our Business Strategy**\\n\\nThe core components of our business strategy are:\\n\\n*Investment in CRE assets*. We are currently invested in CRE whole loans, CRE mezzanine loans and CRE investments. Our goal is to allocate 90% to 100% of our equity to our CRE assets.\\n\\n*Managing our investment portfolio.* At December 31, 2022, we managed \\\\$2.1 billion of assets, including \\\\$1.5 billion of assets that were financed and held in variable interest entities. The core of our management process is credit analysis, which our Manager, with the assistance of ACRES, uses to actively monitor our existing investments and as a basis for evaluating new investments. Senior management of ACRES has extensive experience in underwriting the credit risk associated with our targeted asset classes and conducts detailed due diligence on all investments. After we make investments, our Manager actively monitors them for early detection of trouble or deterioration. If a default occurs, we will use our senior management team\\'s asset management experience in seeking to mitigate the severity of any loss and to optimize the recovery from assets collateralizing the investment.\\n\\n*Managing our interest rate, pricing and liquidity risk*. We engage in a number of business activities that are vulnerable to interest rate, pricing and liquidity risk and we seek to manage those risks. The risks on our long-term financing agreements, principally our term financing facilities, are managed by seeking to match the maturity and repricing dates of our financed investments with the maturities and repricing dates of our long-term financing facilities. Additionally, we seek to match investment and financing maturity and repricing dates using securitization vehicles structured by our Manager and, subject to the availability of markets for securitization financings, we expect to continue to use securitizations in the future to accomplish our long-term match funding financing strategy.\\n\\n|                                              | Outstanding<br>Borrowings(1) |           | Value of Collateral |           | Equity at Risk (2) |         |\\n|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------|---------------------|-----------|--------------------|---------|\\n| At December 31, 2022:                        |                              |           |                     |           |                    |         |\\n| CRE Securitizations                          |                              |           |                     |           |                    |         |\\n| ACR 2021-FL1                                 | \\\\$                           | 671,397   | \\\\$                  | 802,643   | \\\\$                 | 127,420 |\\n| ACR 2021-FL2                                 |                              | 562,159   |                     | 700,000   |                    | 133,000 |\\n| Senior Secured Financing Facility            |                              |           |                     |           |                    |         |\\n| Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company  | \\\\$                           | 87,890    | \\\\$                  | 196,837   | \\\\$                 | 105,818 |\\n| CRE -Term Warehouse Financing Facilities     |                              |           |                     |           |                    |         |\\n| JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.                    | \\\\$                           | 186,783   | \\\\$                  | 255,095   | \\\\$                 | 68,768  |\\n| Morgan Stanley Mortgage Capital Holdings LLC |                              | 141,505   |                     | 198,455   |                    | 56,817  |\\n| Mortgage Payable                             |                              |           |                     |           |                    |         |\\n| Readycap Commercial, LLC                     | \\\\$                           | 18,244    | \\\\$                  | 25,400    | \\\\$                 | 6,602   |\\n| Total                                        | \\\\$                           | 1,667,978 | \\\\$                  | 2,178,430 |                    |         |\\n\\nAt December 31, 2022, our CRE securitizations, financing facilities with debt outstanding, and mortgage payable were as follows (in thousands):\\n\\n(1) CRE securitizations, senior secured financing facility and mortgage payable include deferred debt issuance costs. Term warehouse financing facilities include accrued interest payable and deferred debt issuance costs.\\n\\n(2) The senior secured financing facility and term warehouse financing facilities include accrued interest receivable and accrued interest payable, which are excluded from the value of collateral. CRE securitizations reflect the par value of equity investments in retained notes.\\n\\nThe CRE securitizations, senior secured financing facility, term warehouse financing facilities and mortgage payable charge a floating rate of interest. For more information concerning our CRE securitizations, senior secured financing facility, term facilities and mortgage payable, see \"Item 7. Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources,\" and Note 12 contained in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\" of this report. We continuously monitor our compliance with all of the financial covenants. We were in compliance with all financial covenants, as defined in the respective agreements, at December 31, 2022.\\n\\n{12}------------------------------------------------\\n\\n*Diversification of investments*. We manage our investment risk by maintaining a diversified portfolio of CRE mortgage loans and other CRE-related investments. As funds become available for investment or reinvestment, we seek to maintain diversification by property type and geographic location while allocating our capital to investment opportunities that we believe are the most economically attractive. The percentage of assets that we have invested in certain non-qualifying, non-core and other real estate-related investments is subject to the federal income tax requirements for REIT qualification and the requirements for exclusion from regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, or the Investment Company Act.\\n\\n### **Our Operating Policies**\\n\\n*Investment guidelines.* We have established investment policies, procedures and guidelines that are reviewed and approved by our Manager\\'s investment committee and our Board. The investment committee and/or our Board, as applicable, meets regularly to consider and approve proposed specific investments. Our Board monitors the execution of our overall investment strategies and targeted asset classes. We acquire our investments primarily for income. We do not have a policy that requires us to focus our investments in one or more particular geographic areas or industries.\\n\\n*Financing policies.* We use leverage in order to increase potential returns to our stockholders and for financing our portfolio. We do not speculate on changes in interest rates. Although we have identified leverage targets for each of our targeted asset classes, our investment policies do not have any minimum or maximum leverage limits. Our Manager\\'s investment committee has the discretion, without the need for further approval by our Board, to increase the amount of leverage we incur above our targeted range for individual asset classes subject, however, to any leverage constraints that may be imposed by existing financing arrangements.\\n\\nWe use borrowing and securitization strategies to accomplish our long-term match funding financing strategy. Based upon current conditions in the credit markets for collateralized debt obligations and collateralized loan obligations (sometimes, collectively, referred to as CDOs and CLOs) we expect to modestly increase leverage through new CRE debt securitizations and the continued use of our senior secured financing facility and term financing facilities. We may also seek other credit arrangements to finance new investments that we believe can generate attractive risk-adjusted returns, subject to availability.\\n\\n*Credit and risk management policies.* Our Manager focuses its attention on credit and risk assessment from the earliest stage of the investment selection process. In addition, our Manager screens and monitors all potential investments to determine their impact on maintaining our REIT qualification under federal income tax laws and our exclusion from investment company status under the Investment Company Act. Portfolio risks, including risks related to credit losses, interest rate volatility, liquidity and counterparty credit, are generally managed on an asset and portfolio type basis by our Manager.\\n\\n### **Floating-Rate Loan Portfolio and Borrowings**\\n\\nAs discussed in the \"Managing our interest rate, pricing and liquidity risk\" section above, our investments in floating-rate assets and utilization of floating-rate borrowings expose us to interest rate risk. In a business environment where benchmark interest rates are increasing significantly, cash flows of the CRE assets underlying our loans may not be sufficient to pay debt service on our loans, which could result in non-performance or default. We partially mitigate this risk by generally requiring our borrowers to purchase interest rate cap agreements with non-affiliated, well-capitalized third parties and by selectively requiring our borrowers to have and maintain debt service reserves. These interest rate caps generally mature prior to the maturity date of the loan and the borrowers are required to pay to extend them. In most cases the sponsors will need to fund additional equity into the properties to cover these costs as the property may not generate sufficient cash flow to pay these costs. At December 31, 2022, 88.8% of the par value of our CRE loan portfolio had interest rate caps in place with a weighted-average maturity of 1.1 years.\\n\\nHistorically, we have used the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") as the benchmark interest rate for our floating-rate whole loans and we have been exposed to LIBOR through our floating-rate borrowings. Many of our floating-rate whole loans, CRE securitizations and term warehouse financing facilities included one-month LIBOR as the original contractual benchmark interest rate. Our unsecured junior subordinated debentures use three-month LIBOR as the contractual benchmark interest rate. In March 2021, the United Kingdom\\'s, or U.K.\\'s, Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\") announced that it would cease publication of the one-week and the two-month USD LIBOR immediately after December 31, 2021, and cease publication of the remaining tenors immediately after June 30, 2023. In July 2021, the U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprising large U.S. financial institutions, has identified Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR.\\n\\nAll variable rate loans originated by us beginning January 1, 2022 have been benchmarked to SOFR. Additionally, all of our floating-rate whole loans contain provisions that provide for the transition of the contractual benchmark interest rate to an alternative rate. At December 31, 2022, our loan portfolio had a carrying value of \\\\$2.0 billion of floating rate loans, 68.3% or \\\\$1.4 billion of which have interest rates tied to LIBOR and 31.7% or \\\\$646.2 million of which have interest rates tied to SOFR.\\n\\n{13}------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIn September 2021 and January 2022, the term warehouse financing facilities with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (\"JPMorgan Chase\") and Morgan Stanley Mortgage Capital Holdings LLC (\"Morgan Stanley\"), respectively, were amended to allow for the transition to alternative rates, including rates tied to SOFR, subject to benchmark transition events. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2022, we entered into a loan agreement to finance the acquisition of a student housing complex, which uses SOFR as its benchmark interest rate. At December 31, 2022, we had \\\\$1.7 billion of floating rate borrowings, 75.8% or \\\\$1.3 billion of which have interest rates tied to LIBOR and 24.2% or \\\\$419.2 million of which have interest rates tied to SOFR.\\n\\nWe expect to complete the process of converting our LIBOR-based loans and borrowings to an applicable benchmark interest rate during 2023.\\n\\nRefer to \"Part I. - Item 1A. Risk Factors - Changes in the method for determining the LIBOR or a replacement of LIBOR may adversely affect the value of our loans, investments and borrowings and could affect our results of operations\" for additional detail about the transition away from LIBOR.\\n\\n# **Investment Portfolio**\\n\\nThe table below summarizes the amortized costs and net carrying amounts of our investments at December 31, 2022, classified by asset type (dollars in thousands, except amounts in footnotes):\\n\\n| At December 31, 2022                   | Amortized Cost  | Net Carrying<br>Amount (1) | Percent of<br>Portfolio | Weighted<br>Average Coupon |\\n|----------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|\\n| Loans held for investment:             |                 |                            |                         |                            |\\n| CRE whole loans, floating-rate         | \\\\$<br>2,052,890 | \\\\$<br>2,038,787            | 93.56%                  | 7.99%                      |\\n| CRE mezzanine loan                     | 4,700           | —                          | 0.00%                   | 10.00%                     |\\n|                                        | 2,057,590       | 2,038,787                  | 93.56%                  |                            |\\n| Other investments:                     |                 |                            |                         |                            |\\n| Investments in unconsolidated entities | 1,548           | 1,548                      | 0.07%                   | N/A (4)                    |\\n| Investments in real estate (2)         | 88,132          | 88,132                     | 4.04%                   | N/A (4)                    |\\n| Properties held for sale (3)           | 50,744          | 50,744                     | 2.33%                   | N/A (4)                    |\\n|                                        | 140,424         | 140,424                    | 6.44%                   |                            |\\n|                                        |                 |                            |                         |                            |\\n| Total investment portfolio             | \\\\$<br>2,198,014 | \\\\$<br>2,179,211            | 100.00%                 |                            |\\n\\n(1) Net carrying amount includes an allowance for credit losses of \\\\$18.8 million.\\n\\n(2) Includes real estate-related right of use assets of \\\\$19.5 million, mortgage payable of \\\\$18.2 million, intangible assets of \\\\$8.9 million, lease liabilities of \\\\$42.9 million and other liabilities of \\\\$64,000.\\n\\n(3) Includes property held for sale-related liabilities of \\\\$3.0 million.\\n\\n(4) There are no stated rates associated with these investments.\\n\\nWe hold investments in 100% of the common shares of two trusts, Resource Capital Trust I and RCC Trust II, that were formed for the purpose of providing us with unsecured junior subordinated debt financing and are accounted for as investments in unconsolidated entities.\\n\\n# *CRE Debt Investments*\\n\\n*Floating-rate whole loans.* We predominantly originate floating-rate first mortgage loans, or whole loans, directly to borrowers. The direct origination of whole loans enables us to better control the structure of the loans and to maintain direct lending relationships with borrowers. Additionally, we may acquire whole loans from third parties that conform to our investment strategy. We may create tranches of a loan we originate, consisting of an A-note (described below) and a B-note (described below), as well as mezzanine loans or other participations, which we may hold or sell to third parties. We do not obtain ratings on these investments. With respect to our portfolio at December 31, 2022, our whole loan investments had loan-to-collateral value, or LTV, ratios that typically do not exceed 85%. Typically, our whole loans are structured with an original term of up to three years, with one-year extensions that bring the loan to a maximum term of five years. Substantially all of our CRE loans held at December 31, 2022 were whole loans. We expect to hold our whole loans to maturity.\\n\\n*Senior interests in whole loans (A-notes***).** We may invest in senior interests in whole loans, referred to as A-notes, either directly originated or purchased from third parties. We do not intend to obtain ratings on these investments. We expect our typical Anote investments to have LTV ratios not exceeding 70% and will generally be structured with an original term of up to three years, with one-year extensions that bring the loan to a maximum term of five years. We expect to hold any A-note investments to maturity. We did not hold any A-note investments at December 31, 2022.\\n\\n{14}------------------------------------------------\\n\\n*Subordinate interests in whole loans (B-notes*). To a lesser extent, we may invest in subordinate interests in whole loans, referred to as B-notes, which we will either directly originate or purchase from third parties. B-notes are loans secured by a first mortgage but are subordinated to an A-note. The subordination of a B-note is generally evidenced by an intercreditor or participation agreement between the holders of the A-note and the B-note. In some instances, the B-note lender may require a security interest in the stock or other equity interests of the borrower as part of the transaction. B-note lenders have the same obligations, collateral and borrower as the A-note lender, but typically are subordinated in recovery upon a default to the A-note lender. B-notes share certain credit characteristics with second mortgages in that both are subject to greater credit risk with respect to the underlying mortgage collateral than the corresponding first mortgage or A-note. We do not intend to obtain ratings on these investments. We expect our typical B-note investments to have LTV ratios between 55% and 80% and will generally be structured with an original term of up to three years, with one-year extensions that bring the loan to a maximum term of five years. We expect to hold any B-note investments to maturity. We did not hold any B-note investments at December 31, 2022.\\n\\nIn addition to the accrued interest receivable on a B-note, we may earn fees charged to the borrower under the note or additional income by receiving principal payments in excess of the discounted price (below par value) we paid to acquire the note. Our ownership of a B-note with controlling class rights may, in the event the financing fails to perform according to its terms, cause us to pursue our remedies as owner of the B-note, which may include foreclosure on, or modification of, the note. In some cases, the owner of the Anote may be able to foreclose or modify the note against our wishes as owner of the B-note. As a result, our economic and business interests may diverge from the interests of the owner of the A-note.\\n\\n*Mezzanine financing*. Historically, we have invested in mezzanine loans that are senior to the borrower\\'s equity in, and subordinate to the mortgage loan on, a property. A mezzanine loan is typically secured by a pledge of the ownership interests in the entity that directly owns the real property or by a second lien mortgage loan on the property. In addition, mezzanine loans typically include credit enhancements such as letters of credit, personal guarantees of the principals of the borrower, or collateral unrelated to the property. A mezzanine loan may be structured so that we receive a stated fixed or variable interest rate on the loan as well as a percentage of gross revenues and a percentage of the increase in the fair market value of the property securing the loan, payable upon maturity, refinancing or sale of the property. Mezzanine loans may also have prepayment lockouts, penalties, minimum profit hurdles and other mechanisms to protect and enhance returns in the event of premature repayment. At December 31, 2022, our loan portfolio included one mezzanine loan with no carrying value.\\n\\n*Preferred equity investments.* Historically, we have invested in preferred equity investments in entities that own or acquire CRE properties. These investments are subordinate to first mortgage loans and mezzanine debt and are typically structured to provide some credit enhancement differentiating it from the common equity. We expect our preferred equity investments to have LTV ratios between 65% and 90% with stated maturities from three to eight years. We expect to hold preferred equity investments to maturity. We did not hold any preferred equity investments at December 31, 2022.\\n\\n{15}------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe following charts describe the property type and the geographic breakdown, by National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries (\"NCREIF\") region of our CRE loan portfolio at December 31, 2022 (based on carrying value):\\n\\n![](_page_15_Figure_1.jpeg)\\n\\n![](_page_15_Figure_4.jpeg)\\n\\nThe total CRE loan portfolio, at carrying value, was \\\\$2.0 billion at December 31, 2022.\\n\\nThe Southwest region constituted 23.2% of our portfolio, of which 100.0% was in Texas, and its collateral comprised 95.6% multifamily properties. The Southeast region constituted 21.5% of our portfolio, of which 79.5% was in Florida, and its collateral comprised 85.7% multifamily properties. The Mountain region constituted 16.2% of our portfolio, of which 68.8% was in Arizona, and its collateral comprised 76.5% multifamily properties. We view our investment and credit strategies as being adequately diversified across property types in the Southwest, Southeast and Mountain regions.\\n\\n{16}------------------------------------------------\\n\\n# *CRE Investments*\\n\\nWe may invest directly in the ownership of CRE equity investments by making direct investments where NOL carryforwards exist and can absorb the creation of REIT taxable income or by restructuring CRE loans and taking control of the properties where we believe we can protect capital and ultimately generate capital appreciation. We may acquire CRE equity investments through a joint venture or wholly-owned subsidiary and may classify these investments in real estate as held for investment or held for sale. We intend to primarily use an affiliate of our Manager to manage the CRE equity investments when held. At December 31, 2022, we held four investments in real estate acquired through direct equity investments and two investments in real estate acquired from lending activities (i.e. through the receipt of the deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure on the properties that collateralized former non-performing loans). At December 31, 2022, two of these investments were classified as held for sale.\\n\\nThe following table summarizes the investments in real estate at December 31, 2022 (in thousands, except amounts in footnotes):\\n\\n|                                                     | December 31, 2022 |            |    |                                |    |                |  |\\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------|------------|----|--------------------------------|----|----------------|--|\\n|                                                     | Accumulated       |            |    |                                |    |                |  |\\n|                                                     |                   | Cost Basis |    | Depreciation &<br>Amortization |    | Carrying Value |  |\\n| Assets acquired:                                    |                   |            |    |                                |    |                |  |\\n| Investments in real estate, equity:                 |                   |            |    |                                |    |                |  |\\n| Investments in real estate (1)                      | \\\\$                | 123,219    | \\\\$ | (2,251)                        | \\\\$ | 120,968        |  |\\n| Right of use assets (2)                             |                   | 19,664     |    | (205)                          |    | 19,459         |  |\\n| Intangible assets (3)                               |                   | 11,474     |    | (2,594)                        |    | 8,880          |  |\\n| Subtotal                                            |                   | 154,357    |    | (5,050)                        |    | 149,307        |  |\\n|                                                     |                   |            |    |                                |    |                |  |\\n| Investments in real estate from lending activities: |                   |            |    |                                |    |                |  |\\n| Properties held for sale (4)                        |                   | 53,769     |    | —                              |    | 53,769         |  |\\n| Total                                               |                   | 208,126    |    | (5,050)                        |    | 203,076        |  |\\n|                                                     |                   |            |    |                                |    |                |  |\\n| Liabilities assumed:                                |                   |            |    |                                |    |                |  |\\n| Investments in real estate, equity:                 |                   |            |    |                                |    |                |  |\\n| Mortgage payable                                    |                   | 18,089     |    | 155                            |    | 18,244         |  |\\n| Other liabilities                                   |                   | 247        |    | (183)                          |    | 64             |  |\\n| Lease liabilities (5)                               |                   | 43,260     |    | (393)                          |    | 42,867         |  |\\n| Subtotal                                            |                   | 61,596     |    | (421)                          |    | 61,175         |  |\\n|                                                     |                   |            |    |                                |    |                |  |\\n| Investments in real estate from lending activities: |                   |            |    |                                |    |                |  |\\n| Liabilities held for sale                           |                   | 3,025      |    | —                              |    | 3,025          |  |\\n| Total                                               |                   | 64,621     |    | (421)                          |    | 64,200         |  |\\n|                                                     |                   |            |    |                                |    |                |  |\\n| Total net investments in real estate and properties |                   |            |    |                                |    |                |  |\\n| held for sale (6)                                   | \\\\$                | 143,505    |    |                                | \\\\$ | 138,876        |  |\\n\\n(1) Includes \\\\$38.4 million of land, which is not depreciable.\\n\\n(2) Includes a right of use associated with an acquired ground lease of \\\\$42.4 million accounted for as an operating lease, an above-market lease intangible asset of \\\\$19.0 million and a customer list intangible of \\\\$402,000.
