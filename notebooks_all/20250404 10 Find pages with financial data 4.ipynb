These transactions will continue to be very accretive to our remaining shareholders in the coming years, and we maintain excess capital to repeat this strategy when the opportunity is right. We all witnessed interest rates soar in 2022 as the Fed made significant policy changes to key interest rates in an effort to combat inflation. The Fed increased interest rates seven times during the year for a total of 425 basis points or 4.25%. The velocity of this increase was unprecedented in recent history. The speed of these rate increases over the year created several challenges for managing the balance sheet of a bank and created significant unrealized losses on government securities held in banks. The Fed's rapid monetary policy changes also created significant liquidity and funding challenges for many banks, primarily due to these unrealized losses. We saw the impact of these factors play out in March 2023 with two bank failures and one voluntary bank closure. Guaranty is in a stronger position because we maintained our discipline and did not chase small incremental earnings over the last two years at the expense of taking on significant interest rate risk on our balance sheet. The issue of duration mismatch in assets versus liabilities is at the heart of the recent bank failures and problems that some banks are having. Duration mismatch occurs as banks make long-term, fixed-rate loans or buy long duration government bonds, but issue short-term deposits to fund those loans. This works well until rates go up, however, and if rates go up materially, and the bank has too much concentration in these assets, it can be catastrophic. These failures to properly manage interest rate and liquidity risks are nothing new to banking. They were also at the root of the savings and loan failures in the 1980's. At Guaranty, we took a more conservative approach to managing our liquidity in 2022. We sacrificed some earnings by maintaining large balances of cash rather than investing significant portions of that liquidity in long term securities with yields between 1% and 2% at the time. We believed rates could go up, and even if they didn't, we weren't willing to take the significant interest rate and liquidity risk those investments required for minimal increases in short term earnings. As a result, Guaranty weathered this increasing rate environment with a moderate impact to our balance sheet and liquidity. We held only modest levels of long duration government securities as a percentage of our total assets and capital, which positioned us to successfully navigate the rapid change in rates, without a significant negative impact to our balance sheet and capital. Unrealized losses on all government securities held by our Bank is a moderate 18% of total capital, and our liquidity remains strong.\n",

We saw the impact of these factors play out in March 2023 with two bank failures and one voluntary bank closure. Guaranty is in a stronger position because we maintained our discipline and did not chase small incremental earnings over the last two years at the expense of taking on significant interest rate risk on our balance sheet. The issue of duration mismatch in assets versus liabilities is at the heart of the recent bank failures and problems that some banks are having. Duration mismatch occurs as banks make long-term, fixed-rate loans or buy long duration government bonds, but issue short-term deposits to fund those loans. This works well until rates go up, however, and if rates go up materially, and the bank has too much concentration in these assets, it can be catastrophic. These failures to properly manage interest rate and liquidity risks are nothing new to banking. They were also at the root of the savings and loan failures in the 1980's. At Guaranty, we took a more conservative approach to managing our liquidity in 2022. We sacrificed some earnings by maintaining large balances of cash rather than investing significant portions of that liquidity in long term securities with yields between 1% and 2% at the time. We believed rates could go up, and even if they didn't, we weren't willing to take the significant interest rate and liquidity risk those investments required for minimal increases in short term earnings. As a result, Guaranty weathered this increasing rate environment with a moderate impact to our balance sheet and liquidity. We held only modest levels of long duration government securities as a percentage of our total assets and capital, which positioned us to successfully navigate the rapid change in rates, without a significant negative impact to our balance sheet and capital. Unrealized losses on all government securities held by our Bank is a moderate 18% of total capital, and our liquidity remains strong.\n",

The speed of these rate increases over the year created several challenges for managing the balance sheet of a bank and created significant unrealized losses on government securities held in banks. The Fed's rapid monetary policy changes also created significant liquidity and funding challenges for many banks, primarily due to these unrealized losses. We saw the impact of these factors play out in March 2023 with two bank failures and one voluntary bank closure. Guaranty is in a stronger position because we maintained our discipline and did not chase small incremental earnings over the last two years at the expense of taking on significant interest rate risk on our balance sheet. The issue of duration mismatch in assets versus liabilities is at the heart of the recent bank failures and problems that some banks are having. Duration mismatch occurs as banks make long-term, fixed-rate loans or buy long duration government bonds, but issue short-term deposits to fund those loans. This works well until rates go up, however, and if rates go up materially, and the bank has too much concentration in these assets, it can be catastrophic. These failures to properly manage interest rate and liquidity risks are nothing new to banking. They were also at the root of the savings and loan failures in the 1980's. At Guaranty, we took a more conservative approach to managing our liquidity in 2022. We sacrificed some earnings by maintaining large balances of cash rather than investing significant portions of that liquidity in long term securities with yields between 1% and 2% at the time. We believed rates could go up, and even if they didn't, we weren't willing to take the significant interest rate and liquidity risk those investments required for minimal increases in short term earnings. As a result, Guaranty weathered this increasing rate environment with a moderate impact to our balance sheet and liquidity. We held only modest levels of long duration government securities as a percentage of our total assets and capital, which positioned us to successfully navigate the rapid change in rates, without a significant negative impact to our balance sheet and capital. Unrealized losses on all government securities held by our Bank is a moderate 18% of total capital, and our liquidity remains strong.\n",

We all witnessed interest rates soar in 2022 as the Fed made significant policy changes to key interest rates in an effort to combat inflation. The Fed increased interest rates seven times during the year for a total of 425 basis points or 4.25%. The velocity of this increase was unprecedented in recent history. The speed of these rate increases over the year created several challenges for managing the balance sheet of a bank and created significant unrealized losses on government securities held in banks. The Fed's rapid monetary policy changes also created significant liquidity and funding challenges for many banks, primarily due to these unrealized losses. We saw the impact of these factors play out in March 2023 with two bank failures and one voluntary bank closure. Guaranty is in a stronger position because we maintained our discipline and did not chase small incremental earnings over the last two years at the expense of taking on significant interest rate risk on our balance sheet. The issue of duration mismatch in assets versus liabilities is at the heart of the recent bank failures and problems that some banks are having. Duration mismatch occurs as banks make long-term, fixed-rate loans or buy long duration government bonds, but issue short-term deposits to fund those loans. This works well until rates go up, however, and if rates go up materially, and the bank has too much concentration in these assets, it can be catastrophic. These failures to properly manage interest rate and liquidity risks are nothing new to banking. They were also at the root of the savings and loan failures in the 1980's. At Guaranty, we took a more conservative approach to managing our liquidity in 2022. We sacrificed some earnings by maintaining large balances of cash rather than investing significant portions of that liquidity in long term securities with yields between 1% and 2% at the time. We believed rates could go up, and even if they didn't, we weren't willing to take the significant interest rate and liquidity risk those investments required for minimal increases in short term earnings. As a result, Guaranty weathered this increasing rate environment with a moderate impact to our balance sheet and liquidity. We held only modest levels of long duration government securities as a percentage of our total assets and capital, which positioned us to successfully navigate the rapid change in rates, without a significant negative impact to our balance sheet and capital. Unrealized losses on all government securities held by our Bank is a moderate 18% of total capital, and our liquidity remains strong.\n",

These transactions will continue to be very accretive to our remaining shareholders in the coming years, and we maintain excess capital to repeat this strategy when the opportunity is right. We all witnessed interest rates soar in 2022 as the Fed made significant policy changes to key interest rates in an effort to combat inflation. The Fed increased interest rates seven times during the year for a total of 425 basis points or 4.25%. The velocity of this increase was unprecedented in recent history. The speed of these rate increases over the year created several challenges for managing the balance sheet of a bank and created significant unrealized losses on government securities held in banks. The Fed's rapid monetary policy changes also created significant liquidity and funding challenges for many banks, primarily due to these unrealized losses. We saw the impact of these factors play out in March 2023 with two bank failures and one voluntary bank closure. Guaranty is in a stronger position because we maintained our discipline and did not chase small incremental earnings over the last two years at the expense of taking on significant interest rate risk on our balance sheet. The issue of duration mismatch in assets versus liabilities is at the heart of the recent bank failures and problems that some banks are having. Duration mismatch occurs as banks make long-term, fixed-rate loans or buy long duration government bonds, but issue short-term deposits to fund those loans. This works well until rates go up, however, and if rates go up materially, and the bank has too much concentration in these assets, it can be catastrophic. These failures to properly manage interest rate and liquidity risks are nothing new to banking. They were also at the root of the savings and loan failures in the 1980's. At Guaranty, we took a more conservative approach to managing our liquidity in 2022. We sacrificed some earnings by maintaining large balances of cash rather than investing significant portions of that liquidity in long term securities with yields between 1% and 2% at the time. We believed rates could go up, and even if they didn't, we weren't willing to take the significant interest rate and liquidity risk those investments required for minimal increases in short term earnings. As a result, Guaranty weathered this increasing rate environment with a moderate impact to our balance sheet and liquidity. We held only modest levels of long duration government securities as a percentage of our total assets and capital, which positioned us to successfully navigate the rapid change in rates, without a significant negative impact to our balance sheet and capital. Unrealized losses on all government securities held by our Bank is a moderate 18% of total capital, and our liquidity remains strong.\n",

These transactions will continue to be very accretive to our remaining shareholders in the coming years, and we maintain excess capital to repeat this strategy when the opportunity is right. We all witnessed interest rates soar in 2022 as the Fed made significant policy changes to key interest rates in an effort to combat inflation. The Fed increased interest rates seven times during the year for a total of 425 basis points or 4.25%. The velocity of this increase was unprecedented in recent history. The speed of these rate increases over the year created several challenges for managing the balance sheet of a bank and created significant unrealized losses on government securities held in banks. The Fed's rapid monetary policy changes also created significant liquidity and funding challenges for many banks, primarily due to these unrealized losses. We saw the impact of these factors play out in March 2023 with two bank failures and one voluntary bank closure. Guaranty is in a stronger position because we maintained our discipline and did not chase small incremental earnings over the last two years at the expense of taking on significant interest rate risk on our balance sheet. The issue of duration mismatch in assets versus liabilities is at the heart of the recent bank failures and problems that some banks are having. Duration mismatch occurs as banks make long-term, fixed-rate loans or buy long duration government bonds, but issue short-term deposits to fund those loans. This works well until rates go up, however, and if rates go up materially, and the bank has too much concentration in these assets, it can be catastrophic. These failures to properly manage interest rate and liquidity risks are nothing new to banking. They were also at the root of the savings and loan failures in the 1980's. At Guaranty, we took a more conservative approach to managing our liquidity in 2022. We sacrificed some earnings by maintaining large balances of cash rather than investing significant portions of that liquidity in long term securities with yields between 1% and 2% at the time. We believed rates could go up, and even if they didn't, we weren't willing to take the significant interest rate and liquidity risk those investments required for minimal increases in short term earnings. As a result, Guaranty weathered this increasing rate environment with a moderate impact to our balance sheet and liquidity. We held only modest levels of long duration government securities as a percentage of our total assets and capital, which positioned us to successfully navigate the rapid change in rates, without a significant negative impact to our balance sheet and capital. Unrealized losses on all government securities held by our Bank is a moderate 18% of total capital, and our liquidity remains strong.\n",

These transactions will continue to be very accretive to our remaining shareholders in the coming years, and we maintain excess capital to repeat this strategy when the opportunity is right. We all witnessed interest rates soar in 2022 as the Fed made significant policy changes to key interest rates in an effort to combat inflation. The Fed increased interest rates seven times during the year for a total of 425 basis points or 4.25%. The velocity of this increase was unprecedented in recent history. The speed of these rate increases over the year created several challenges for managing the balance sheet of a bank and created significant unrealized losses on government securities held in banks. The Fed's rapid monetary policy changes also created significant liquidity and funding challenges for many banks, primarily due to these unrealized losses. We saw the impact of these factors play out in March 2023 with two bank failures and one voluntary bank closure. Guaranty is in a stronger position because we maintained our discipline and did not chase small incremental earnings over the last two years at the expense of taking on significant interest rate risk on our balance sheet. The issue of duration mismatch in assets versus liabilities is at the heart of the recent bank failures and problems that some banks are having. Duration mismatch occurs as banks make long-term, fixed-rate loans or buy long duration government bonds, but issue short-term deposits to fund those loans. This works well until rates go up, however, and if rates go up materially, and the bank has too much concentration in these assets, it can be catastrophic. These failures to properly manage interest rate and liquidity risks are nothing new to banking. They were also at the root of the savings and loan failures in the 1980's. At Guaranty, we took a more conservative approach to managing our liquidity in 2022. We sacrificed some earnings by maintaining large balances of cash rather than investing significant portions of that liquidity in long term securities with yields between 1% and 2% at the time. We believed rates could go up, and even if they didn't, we weren't willing to take the significant interest rate and liquidity risk those investments required for minimal increases in short term earnings. As a result, Guaranty weathered this increasing rate environment with a moderate impact to our balance sheet and liquidity. We held only modest levels of long duration government securities as a percentage of our total assets and capital, which positioned us to successfully navigate the rapid change in rates, without a significant negative impact to our balance sheet and capital. Unrealized losses on all government securities held by our Bank is a moderate 18% of total capital, and our liquidity remains strong.\n",

These transactions will continue to be very accretive to our remaining shareholders in the coming years, and we maintain excess capital to repeat this strategy when the opportunity is right. We all witnessed interest rates soar in 2022 as the Fed made significant policy changes to key interest rates in an effort to combat inflation. The Fed increased interest rates seven times during the year for a total of 425 basis points or 4.25%. The velocity of this increase was unprecedented in recent history. The speed of these rate increases over the year created several challenges for managing the balance sheet of a bank and created significant unrealized losses on government securities held in banks. The Fed's rapid monetary policy changes also created significant liquidity and funding challenges for many banks, primarily due to these unrealized losses. We saw the impact of these factors play out in March 2023 with two bank failures and one voluntary bank closure. Guaranty is in a stronger position because we maintained our discipline and did not chase small incremental earnings over the last two years at the expense of taking on significant interest rate risk on our balance sheet. The issue of duration mismatch in assets versus liabilities is at the heart of the recent bank failures and problems that some banks are having. Duration mismatch occurs as banks make long-term, fixed-rate loans or buy long duration government bonds, but issue short-term deposits to fund those loans. This works well until rates go up, however, and if rates go up materially, and the bank has too much concentration in these assets, it can be catastrophic. These failures to properly manage interest rate and liquidity risks are nothing new to banking. They were also at the root of the savings and loan failures in the 1980's. At Guaranty, we took a more conservative approach to managing our liquidity in 2022. We sacrificed some earnings by maintaining large balances of cash rather than investing significant portions of that liquidity in long term securities with yields between 1% and 2% at the time. We believed rates could go up, and even if they didn't, we weren't willing to take the significant interest rate and liquidity risk those investments required for minimal increases in short term earnings. As a result, Guaranty weathered this increasing rate environment with a moderate impact to our balance sheet and liquidity. We held only modest levels of long duration government securities as a percentage of our total assets and capital, which positioned us to successfully navigate the rapid change in rates, without a significant negative impact to our balance sheet and capital. Unrealized losses on all government securities held by our Bank is a moderate 18% of total capital, and our liquidity remains strong.\n",

      "discounted prices when opportunities are favorable for shareholders. In 2022, we repurchased 2% of our common shares outstanding. These transactions will continue to be very accretive to our remaining shareholders in the coming years, and we maintain excess capital to repeat this strategy when the opportunity is right. We all witnessed interest rates soar in 2022 as the Fed made significant policy changes to key interest rates in an effort to combat inflation. The Fed increased interest rates seven times during the year for a total of 425 basis points or 4.25%. The velocity of this increase was unprecedented in recent history. The speed of these rate increases over the year created several challenges for managing the balance sheet of a bank and created significant unrealized losses on government securities held in banks. The Fed's rapid monetary policy changes also created significant liquidity and funding challenges for many banks, primarily due to these unrealized losses. We saw the impact of these factors play out in March 2023 with two bank failures and one voluntary bank closure. Guaranty is in a stronger position because we maintained our discipline and did not chase small incremental earnings over the last two years at the expense of taking on significant interest rate risk on our balance sheet. The issue of duration mismatch in assets versus liabilities is at the heart of the recent bank failures and problems that some banks are having. Duration mismatch occurs as banks make long-term, fixed-rate loans or buy long duration government bonds, but issue short-term deposits to fund those loans. This works well until rates go up, however, and if rates go up materially, and the bank has too much concentration in these assets, it can be catastrophic. These failures to properly manage interest rate and liquidity risks are nothing new to banking. They were also at the root of the savings and loan failures in the 1980's. At Guaranty, we took a more conservative approach to managing our liquidity in 2022. We sacrificed some earnings by maintaining large balances of cash rather than investing significant portions of that liquidity in long term securities with yields between 1% and 2% at the time. We believed rates could go up, and even if they didn't, we weren't willing to take the significant interest rate and liquidity risk those investments required for minimal increases in short term earnings. As a result, Guaranty weathered this increasing rate environment with a moderate impact to our balance sheet and liquidity. We held only modest levels of long duration government securities as a percentage of our total assets and capital, which positioned us to successfully navigate the rapid change in rates, without a significant negative impact to our balance sheet and capital. Unrealized losses on all government securities held by our Bank is a moderate 18% of total capital, and our liquidity remains strong.\n",

      "Guaranty Bancshares realized strong financial results during the year. Total loans for the Company grew \\$470.1 million during the year, to a record high of \\$2.4 billion. Total deposits ended the year with growth of \\$10.3 million and, likewise, a new record total of \\$2.7 billion. One of our primary goals for 2022 was to exceed the previous year's net income, which was a tall order given that 2021 included over \\$7.8 million in PPP-related extraordinary income and a reverse provision to our loan loss reserves of \\$1.7 million. I'm pleased to say we achieved this goal.\n",

      "The Company generated net income of \\$40.4 million, compared to \\$39.8 million in the prior year, a \\$641,000 or a 1.6% increase. We accomplished this result even after taking a \\$3.4 million provision for potential future loan losses during the last quarter of the year. We felt this provision, while no credit losses were imminent or identified, was prudent given the forecast of a possible recession in 2023.\n",

      "It was a tough year for the stock market in 2022, and our stock price was no exception. While we certainly added significant intrinsic value to our Company, our total return for the year was disappointing at -5.5%, including the \\$0.88 per share dividend. This compares to a total return on the NASDAQ of -32.5%, S&P 500 of -18.1%, and our benchmark S&P Small Cap Banks Index of -11.8%.

However, as we entered the first quarter of 2023, we witnessed two bank failures, concerns about the health of the overall banking system and continued discussions of a recession. In the midst of these economic uncertainties and challenges, we remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders while fairly and consistently serving our customers and clients, as we have for 110 years. I will comment on the banking industry issues further into my letter, provide data that highlights how Guaranty is different from the banks that have had trouble and will explain the various strengths of our Company.

Total deposits ended the year with growth of \\$10.3 million and, likewise, a new record total of \\$2.7 billion. One of our primary goals for 2022 was to exceed the previous year's net income, which was a tall order given that 2021 included over \\$7.8 million in PPP-related extraordinary income and a reverse provision to our loan loss reserves of \\$1.7 million.

This compares to a total return on the NASDAQ of -32.5%, S&P 500 of -18.1%, and our benchmark S&P Small Cap Banks Index of -11.8%.

However, as we entered the first quarter of 2023, we witnessed two bank failures, concerns about the health of the overall banking system and continued discussions of a recession. In the midst of these economic uncertainties and challenges, we remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders while fairly and consistently serving our customers and clients, as we have for 110 years. I will comment on the banking industry issues further into my letter, provide data that highlights how Guaranty is different from the banks that have had trouble and will explain the various strengths of our Company.

      "discounted prices when opportunities are favorable for shareholders. In 2022, we repurchased 2% of our common shares outstanding. These transactions will continue to be very accretive to our remaining shareholders in the coming years, and we maintain excess capital to repeat this strategy when the opportunity is right. We all witnessed interest rates soar in 2022 as the Fed made significant policy changes to key interest rates in an effort to combat inflation. The Fed increased interest rates seven times during the year for a total of 425 basis points or 4.25%. The velocity of this increase was unprecedented in recent history. The speed of these rate increases over the year created several challenges for managing the balance sheet of a bank and created significant unrealized losses on government securities held in banks. The Fed's rapid monetary policy changes also created significant liquidity and funding challenges for many banks, primarily due to these unrealized losses. We saw the impact of these factors play out in March 2023 with two bank failures and one voluntary bank closure. Guaranty is in a stronger position because we maintained our discipline and did not chase small incremental earnings over the last two years at the expense of taking on significant interest rate risk on our balance sheet. The issue of duration mismatch in assets versus liabilities is at the heart of the recent bank failures and problems that some banks are having. Duration mismatch occurs as banks make long-term, fixed-rate loans or buy long duration government bonds, but issue short-term deposits to fund those loans. This works well until rates go up, however, and if rates go up materially, and the bank has too much concentration in these assets, it can be catastrophic. These failures to properly manage interest rate and liquidity risks are nothing new to banking. They were also at the root of the savings and loan failures in the 1980's. At Guaranty, we took a more conservative approach to managing our liquidity in 2022. We sacrificed some earnings by maintaining large balances of cash rather than investing significant portions of that liquidity in long term securities with yields between 1% and 2% at the time. We believed rates could go up, and even if they didn't, we weren't willing to take the significant interest rate and liquidity risk those investments required for minimal increases in short term earnings. As a result, Guaranty weathered this increasing rate environment with a moderate impact to our balance sheet and liquidity. We held only modest levels of long duration government securities as a percentage of our total assets and capital, which positioned us to successfully navigate the rapid change in rates, without a significant negative impact to our balance sheet and capital. Unrealized losses on all government securities held by our Bank is a moderate 18% of total capital, and our liquidity remains strong.\n",
